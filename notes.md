# Curry, Composition, And You

## What is currying?

- Currying is a technique for changing how many arguments a function takes
- Popularized by, and named after, Haskell Curry
- Actually invented by Moses Sch√∂nfinkel
- "Nothing in math is named after the person that discvered it": Boyer's Law (discovered by Hubery Kennedy)

## How to implement currying?

## Why do we care?

- "Adapter pattern" for functions
- Higher order functions, like map/filter/reduce, have argument requirements
- Partially applying functions so they fit the interface needed
- Very useful for composition!

## Composition

- Given functions f and g, (f . g)(x) = f(g(x))
- Like a backwards Unix pipe: f . g == g | f
- Function composition is the building block of functional programming design
- Composition in OO is not really the same as composition in FP
- Aggregation/Dependency Injection/etc.
- FP composition is almost more like the Decorator pattern

## Functions



## Transformations

## Class as transformation

## Higher order classes
